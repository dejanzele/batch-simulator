## sim run

Run a simulation

### Synopsis

This command initiates the simulation process, creating simulated nodes and pods at a user-configurable rate.
It involves initializing Kubernetes clients, setting up a resource manager with specified rate limits for pods and nodes,
and managing the simulation lifecycle.
The process is designed to mimic real-world Kubernetes environments for testing and analysis purposes.
